Below is the description for the project.

Assignment: Data 420
Instructions
You have been contracted by a small travel company to help them understand the data they are beginning to gather.  They have gathered data from their existing customers for their last vacation(s) and are curious to see if they can use the data to help make more informed suggestions to their clients.  They would also like to see if they could create a group profile of their travellers with the goal of offering a group vacation package.
1.	This work is to be completed individually 
2.	The data can be found in C:/Training/0a058 – use the customers_and_holidays.dat file as your source
3.	Try to use a single stream with multiple branches

Deliverables
1.	Create a list of all fields in the database, and identify fields you feel should be used as Inputs for your predictive model.  Give reasons for excluding fields. (Use a Table or Point form statements)
a.	Example: Customer name – Excluded – This unique identifier should not be used as an input as it likely wouldn’t predict results
2.	Create a new field to calculate the customer’s age at the time of travelling (Screenshot showing new field) 
3.	For the Cluster prediction, describe the method and reasoning used to make each customer distinct. (Customers need to be distinct, if you do not do this, you could potentially end up with one customer in two or more clusters) 
4.	To prepare for the Supervised Model, identify three groups of vacations based on the total amount spent.  The company feels they can ask their customers how much they are willing to spend as part of their vacation design criteria.  (Screenshot of distribution node)
5.	Run an AutoClassifier node and determine the best Supervised Model to use. (Screenshot of Autoclassifier Nugget showing top 3 models)
6.	Run selected Supervised Model (Screenshot of model nugget)
7.	Run AutoCluster node and determine the best Segmentation Model to use. (Screenshot of AutoCluster Nugget showing top 3 models)
8.	Run selected Segmentation Model (Screenshot of model nugget)
9.	Screenshot of Final Stream
